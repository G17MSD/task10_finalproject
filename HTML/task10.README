Hello, and welcome to the README file of my Harvard CS50x task 10 final project. 
In my README file, i will explain the reasons why i have made this site,and how it can be beneficial to those who use it.
Firstly, I wanted to clarify why i made this website.
I have chosen to create a news article based site that allows people to view the top headlines across the world every day.
This project has been a very difficult challenge but I believe that it will help me develop new skills and opportunities.
My main goal is to help others have easier and more effective lives.
The website is by building the structure of a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript in the visual studio application.
I have been also saving all progress and updates in my github repository.
I built the website base from sourcing code from a website called bootstrap and integrating some of their code into my project.
I then proceeded to build the Nav bar using CSS to ensure it fitted the top part of the screen. After this I incorporated the search function to fit within the nav bar of the website. 
Once the search function was added I then proceeded to add the data using an API key to give it the functionality to search locations.  
After extensive research I decided to use an API key from the website NewsAPIâ€™s.com.
